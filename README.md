# Serena Langiano - Data Analyst Portfolio
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## About
Hi, I'm Serena! I have an academic background in Electrical Engineering and currently I am working as Data Analyst in the renewable energy field. In my four years of working experience I've developed a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of Data Analytics, where I can contribute to solving challenging problems and making data-driven decisions that have a tangible impact. 

Throughout my career, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed strong visualization skills. I am proficient in Python, Excel and MySQL, whiche I've utilized to query large relational databases.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf]().

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Data analysis on Climate Change - Italy
**Code:** [`name.ipynb`](link)

**Goal:** To analyse the evolution of the temperature in Italy from 1970 to 2022.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of temperature measurements at 2 meters height in Italy. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the trend of the average temperature in Italy and estimate the annual variation.

**Skills:** data extraction, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Xarray, Geopandas, Shapely.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed a clear trend in the temperature, which is increasing throughout the years. The average increase stands at 0.04ºC for the whole country. Northern Italy is witnessing the highest increase (0.048ºC/year), followed by Central Italy (0.038ºC/year) and Southern Italy (0.035ºC).

## Experience
Data Analyst - EDP
Data Analyst and Project Manager in EU funded projects.
2020 - Present

My achievements include:

- Data Analytics to drive informed decisions in the planning and execution of Operation&Maintenance of PV and offshore wind parks. Key metrics derived from the analysis: energy production, plant availability, weather windows and fault occurrence.
- Statistical analysis on faults in different components of a PV park to assess system health and performance.
- Data cleaning (including the IQR method) to preprocess data and remove outliers.
- Implementation of a GIS-based algorithm (Python) to compute the Levelized Cost of Energy for various renewable energy technologies.
- Data visualisation (Python, Excel, PowerBI) to present data analysis findings to relevant stakeholders.

My current responsibilities also cover: Project Management, Budgeting, Writing and review of projects' Deliverables and Milestones.
