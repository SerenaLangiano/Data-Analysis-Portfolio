# Serena Langiano - Data Analyst Portfolio
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## About
Hi, I'm Serena! I have an academic background in Electrical Engineering and currently I am working as Data Analyst in the renewable energy field. In my 4+ years of working experience I've developed a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of Data Analytics, where I can contribute to solving challenging problems and making data-driven decisions that have a tangible impact. 

Throughout my career, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed strong visualization skills. I am proficient in Python, Excel and MySQL, whiche I've utilized to query large relational databases.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list Data Analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Data analysis on Climate Change - Italy
**Code:** [`Data-analysis-on-Climate-Change-Italy.ipynb`](https://github.com/SerenaLangiano/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Data-analysis-on-Climate-Change-Italy/Data-analysis-on-Climate-Change-Italy.ipynb)

**Goal:** Analyzing temperature evolution in Italy from 1970 to 2022.

**Description:** The project focuses on analyzing a dataset of temperature measurements at 2 meters height in Italy. The project involves loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the trend of the average temperature in Italy and estimating the annual variation.

**Skills:** data extraction, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Xarray, Geopandas, Shapely.

**Results:** The analysis reveals a clear trend in the temperature, which increases throughout the years. The average increase stands at 0.04ºC for the whole country. Northern Italy witnesses the highest increase (0.048ºC/year), followed by Central Italy (0.038ºC/year) and Southern Italy (0.035ºC).

### Marketing campaigns Analysis - Computer software company
**Code:** [`Marketing-Campaigns-analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/SerenaLangiano/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Marketing%20campaign%20analysis/Marketing-Campaigns-analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** Analyzing the performance of four marketing campaigns.

**Description:** The project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing metrics collected during four marketing campaigns. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, implementing a machine learning classifier, analyzing the performance the marketing campaigns.

**Skills:** data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sci-kit learn.

**Results:** The analysis provides clear and immediate insights on the campaigns, including leads breakdown, leads breakdown per source and per status, and which professional domains collected quality leads.

### Ecommerce Analysis with MySQL
**Code:** [`Ecommerce-Analysis-with-MySql`](https://github.com/SerenaLangiano/Portfolio-Projects/blob/d38e6faa28e558cc0d43426235560371dd34f2ac/Ecommerce-Analysis/Readme.md)

**Goal:** Analyzing an eCommerce dataset to gain insights on the data.

**Description:** The project focuses on the analysis of an eCommerce dataset to gain insights on revenues, customer behaviour, products and more. The data is stored in two different databases:

- 'ecommerce' which contains two tables: customers and products;
- 'shipping' containing two tables: orders and oder_items.


**Skills:** database, MySQL, queries.

**Technology:** MySQL

**Results:** Using MySQL queries we want to answer to the following questions:
1.	What is the total revenue for each category?
2.	Which customer has the most orders?
3.	What is the average order value for each customer?	
4.	What is the total revenue for each month?
5.	Which products have been ordered the most and how many times?
6.	Which customers have ordered a particular product and how many times?
7.	What is the average order value for each month? 
8.	What is the average quantity ordered for each product?
9.	Which category has the highest revenue per customer on average?
10.	What is the total revenue for each status and month combination?

## Experience
