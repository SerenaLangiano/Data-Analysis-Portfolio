# Serena Langiano - Data Analyst Portfolio
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## About
Hi, I'm Serena! I have an analytical background in Electrical Engineer and currently, I am on track to completing my degree in Data Science (MS. Data Science). I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf]().

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Experience
Data Analyst - EDP
Data Analyst and Project Manager in EU funded projects.
2020 - Present

My achievements include:

- Data Analytics to drive informed decisions in the planning and execution of Operation&Maintenance of PV and offshore wind parks. Key metrics derived from the analysis: energy production, plant availability, weather windows and fault occurrence.
- Statistical analysis on faults in different components of a PV park to assess system health and performance.
- Data cleaning (including the IQR method) to preprocess data and remove outliers.
- Implementation of a GIS-based algorithm (Python) to compute the Levelized Cost of Energy for various renewable energy technologies.
- Data visualisation (Python, Excel, PowerBI) to present data analysis findings to relevant stakeholders.

My current responsibilities also cover: Project Management, Budgeting, Writing and review of projects' Deliverables and Milestones.
